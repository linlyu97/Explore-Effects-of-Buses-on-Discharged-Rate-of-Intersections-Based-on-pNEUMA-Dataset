# Explore-Effects-of-Buses-on-Discharged-Rate-of-Intersections-Based-on-pNEUMA-Dataset

In this project, firstly we explained the data used for the project and how we deal with the data preprocessing and data filtering to extract useful information. Then we generated the time space diagram for finding the location of the signal and estimated the saturation flow rate when the signal changes from red to green. Finally, we use linear regression to find the relationship between bus ratio and saturation flow rate.
